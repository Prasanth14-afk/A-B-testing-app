A production-ready, interactive web dashboard for analyzing A/B testing results from the Cookie Cats mobile game. Built with Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, and modern data visualization libraries.

## Project Overview

This project combines statistical analysis with interactive data visualization to provide actionable insights on user retention and engagement metrics. The dashboard analyzes over 90,000 user records to determine the optimal placement of game gates (Gate 30 vs Gate 40) and their impact on player behavior.
